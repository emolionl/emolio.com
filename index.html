        <h2>Bioresonance (Video) Course on Device</h2>
        <p>In the following video, you can see what such a scan entails and how the device works with frequencies.</p>
        <p>Doctors know a lot but not everything. Nowadays, people often know much more about their own health through the internet. Thus, they already gather a lot of knowledge about their own health and sometimes even know more than the doctor. Additionally, people often seek solutions outside the regular circuit when not enough results are achieved within it and sometimes benefit from this. I want to gather the potential that people have accumulated about their health so that they can share it with each other. What has helped and what hasn't. By sharing experiences, we can help each other find a good solution for our health faster and cheaper.</p>

        <h2>Meditation Research with Bioresonance Device</h2>
        <p>With bioresonance devices, you can test many things. For example, you can measure AURA before and after meditation. I measured AURA before and after AUM meditation.</p>
        <p>There are many possibilities to measure, for example, fears before and after meditation. This way, you can discover for yourself whether meditation had a good or bad influence on you.</p>

    <section id="therapy">
        <h2>What is Bioresonance Therapy?</h2>
        <p>Scientifically, it has been established that DNA is sensitive to low-frequency electromagnetic fields. Bioresonance uses the electromagnetic vibrations of the person themselves. In people who are ill, the vibration pattern is disrupted by vibrations from, for example, bacteria or pesticides. These pathogenic or sickly vibrations are disharmonious. Bioresonance restores harmony in the body by identifying pathogenic vibrations and sending back healing vibrations.</p>
        <p>The treatment is painless and without side effects. It aims to provide insight into the state of your body and mind and then restore both to their natural state.</p>
        <p>Bioresonance therapy consists of various components. First, the problem is identified through a scan. This allows your entire physical and emotional state to be examined. It looks at the burden of viruses, parasites, and bacteria affecting your health. It also checks for imbalances in vitamins, minerals, and heavy metals, the state of your aura, and whether certain emotions are out of balance. Then, the best way to correct this imbalance is determined. This is done through bioresonance frequencies, drops, nutrition, and possibly other advice applicable to your situation.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="tests">
        <h2>Micro-organisms</h2>
        <p>With bioresonance, you can discover whether your body or any organ or cell contains certain micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, or worms.</p>
        <h2>Emotional Balance</h2>
        <p>With bioresonance, you can discover if your body and emotions are in balance.</p>
        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>A deficiency in vitamins and minerals can cause many problems and lead to imbalance. The bioresonance device can test for such deficiencies or imbalances.</p>
        <h2>Medicine Test</h2>
        <p>It can be checked which medicines have a good effect on our body and which do not.</p>
        <h2>Aura Chakra Measurement</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to see how your aura and chakras are?</p>
        <h2>Thousands of Homeopathic Remedies</h2>
        <p>The frequencies of all homeopathic remedies can be set in water to be used.</p>
